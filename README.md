## ðŸš€ Mission Briefing

### Forge Your Space Epic

Humanity is under siege by a squadron of alien menaces, and you, the valiant captain of the USS Assembly, are humanity's last hope. With your coding prowess, you will craft the saga of space where your ship, armed with lasers and courage, battles through an onslaught of six uniquely programmed alien warcraft.

In this celestial ballet of destruction, the alien vessels have a fatal flawâ€”they're bound by logic, attacking one by one, observing the results before their comrades jump into the fray. But you? You've got the element of surprise and the first strike initiative!

Here's how the cosmic dance unfolds:

* You unleash your firepower on the first alien ship.
* If the extraterrestrial foe withstands your assault, it counterattacks.
* Survive, and you launch another round of space fury.
* Should you obliterate the ship, you face a choice: engage the next enemy or warp away to safety.
* Claim victory by reducing all alien ships to space dust or face defeat if the USS Assembly falls.

## ðŸ›¸ Crafting Your Starship

Every ship in this intergalactic conflict, including your USS Assembly, comes equipped with:

* **Hull**: Think of it as your shield level. Zero means game over.
* **Firepower**: This is the punch your lasers pack.
* **Accuracy**: Your odds of hitting the mark.
* Your trusty USS Assembly boasts a hull integrity of 20, a firepower rating of 5, and targeting accuracy of .7.

But beware, each alien adversary comes with variable stats ranging in hull strength (3-6), firepower (2-4), and targeting systems (.6-.8).
